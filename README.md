# git-scripts

Some useful git (annex) scripts. At least for me ;)

* recreate_commit_timeline.sh - if you forgot to properly commit a few files, this script will add the files and commit them on their creation date, using faketime
* git-whoami.sh - just a stupid git demo I once created for a workshop. It has no real purpose as you hopefully know who you are ;)
* git_annex_find_duplicates.sh - to find duplicate files in your git-annex
* git_rewrite_author_commiter_history.sh - change your name and email in a git history, if you commited with misspelled metadata or the wrong user
